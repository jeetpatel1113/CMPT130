This program demonstrates a game popularly known as the Game of Pigs.
There are two players in the game: a human and a computer.
The game is played in turns where each player plays after the other player stops.
At each turn a player rolls a die several times and sums the points scored to compute a turn score.
The game is won by the player who first reaches a total score of 100 points or more.
Any of the two players can start the game. In this program the computer will start the game.

The computer plays with the following rule:
        It rolls a die repeatedly where at each roll a point between 1 and 6 is scored.
        If the point scored is 1, then the computer turn ends with a score of zero points for the turn.
        If the point scored is not 1, then it is added to the computer turn score and the computer rolls again.
        The computer will stop its turn when its turn score reaches 20 points or more.
Once the computer turn ends, then the human starts playing.

The human plays with the following rule:
        The human rolls a die repeatedly where at each roll a point between 1 and 6 is scored.
        If the point scored is 1, then the human turn ends with zero points for the turn.
        If the point scored is not 1, then it is added to the human turn score.
        The human is then asked to choose to either roll again or to stop the turn.
        If the human chooses to roll again then the human rolls again otherwise the human turn ends.
Once the human turn ends, then the computer starts playing.

Any of the players will also stop its turn when the players wins the game.
